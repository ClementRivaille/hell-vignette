# Hells Vignette

Hells Vignette is a text-only narrative game made with Vue 3. It is about purging a sentence in afterlife while visiting other people's version of eternal punishment. It includes some interactive "torture" sequences requiring keyboard input, but is otherwise mostly a narrative game.

This game was originally made the Potat0s Game Jam of September 2020, which theme was “Hell”.
